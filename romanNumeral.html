// For this challenge you will be implementing the Roman Numeral algorithm. Define a function romanNumeral which accepts a number as an argument. Your function should return a string representation of that number as a Roman numeral. Some helpful Roman numeral conversions are listed below.

// 1     ->    I
// 4     ->    IV
// 5     ->    V
// 9     ->    IX
// 10    ->    X
// 40    ->    XL
// 50    ->    L
// 90    ->    XC
// 100   ->    C
// 400   ->    CD
// 500   ->    D
// 900   ->    CM
// 1000  ->    M

function romanNumeral(num) {
    


}

// Declare a local variable firstName and assign it to a string which is your first name.
// Declare a local variable lastName and assign it to a string which is your last name.
// Use string concatenation to to make a local variable fullName equal to your first and last names separated by a space.
// Make an age local variable equal to an integer which is your age.
// Make a local variable github equal to your Github username.
// Make a local variable email equal to your email.
// Make a local variable phone equal to your phone number.
// Declare a local variable contactInfo which is an array containing your github, email, and phone variables.
// Define a function createApp which takes your fullName, age, and contactInfo as arguments in that order. This should return an object containing each of these values. Make their property names the same as their variable names.
// Define a function romanNumeral and implement it as described above. Your code must work for 80% of the cases listed in order for you to submit your application. Good luck!
